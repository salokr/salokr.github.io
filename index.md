## About Me

Hi there!
I am a second-year PhD student in the Natural Language Processing group at George Mason University, where I have the privilege of being advised by Prof. Ziyu Yao. 

My research revolves around the field of Information Extraction, where I delve into extracting event-specific information from a wide array of sources, including emails, sentences, and documents. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of a versatile machine learning system capable of retrieving event-specific details from unstructured text and presenting them in a structured format, facilitating seamless further processing.

Prior to my journey at GMU, I earned a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology - Patna. Additionally, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Uttar Pradesh Technical University.

In my free time, I make music for violin and piano. I enjoy the outdoors, particularly badminton and mountains.
