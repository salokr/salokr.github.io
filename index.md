## About Me

Hi there!
I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Natural Language Processing group at George Mason University; advised by Dr. [Ziyu Yao](https://ziyuyao.org/). 

My research revolves around the field of Information Extraction and Generative AI, where I delve into extracting event-specific information from a wide array of sources, including emails, sentences, and documents. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of a versatile machine learning system capable of retrieving event-specific details from unstructured text and presenting them in a structured format, facilitating seamless further processing.

Recently, I have also focused on Prompt Optimization for LLMs to elicit correct zero-shot responses from both Open-Source and API-based LLMs. Please check the list of publications for more details.

Prior to my journey at GMU, I earned a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology - Patna. Additionally, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Uttar Pradesh Technical University. I have also served as an NLP researcher at Tata Research from 2017-2021.

In my free time, I make music for violin and piano. I enjoy the outdoors, particularly cricket, badminton, and mountains.
